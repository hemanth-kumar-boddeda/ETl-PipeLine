# ETLproject
Project 2 Rutgers Data Science

Data was sourced through websites like Data.world and Kaggle. We were able to source out 3 datasets for 3 consecutive years on World Happiness Report. All the datasets were in CSV format. The transformation of the datasets included cleaning using Pandas. Using Pandas, unwanted columns were dropped, extracting and renaming the columns needed in different datasets then concatenating the years for each country after which our data was loaded into a relational database (Mysql) for easy access for database administrators etc.
